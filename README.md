# Fork of a fork of a fork of a 3D beatsaber song editor
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/87zY9Te.png)
This is a "fork" of [MediocreMapper by squeaksies](https://github.com/squeaksies/MediocreMapper) which is a "fork" of [EditSaberEnhanced by permissionBRICK](https://github.com/permissionBRICK/EditSaberEnhanced) which is a "fork" of  [EditSaber by Ikeiwa](https://github.com/Ikeiwa/EditSaber). Previously assisting with EditSaberEnhanced, I made this mediocre thing as a set of feature additions on EditSaberEnanced.

## Supports the new BeatSaver schema
If you find any bugs please complain to `williums#0001`, this is all their fault. 

# MediocreMapper changelog
## No longer maintained
 
## Update Mk4
### New Stuff
* **Lightmap** v2 integration
* **Cat** mode. swirly eyed cats are dot notes. Comes with cat hit sounds
* **Metronome** use BPM blocks to configure downbeat
* **Bongo Cat** companion that tests your songs
* **No lighting mode** so you can actually load giant event files
* **Mapping Extensions** support, minus precision walls. But it's got 6 lane, precision placement and angles.
* **Song Loader Fields** `contributors`, `noteJumpSpawnBeatOffset`, `requirements`, `suggestions`, `information`, `warnings`, `characteristics`, `customEnvironment`, `difficultyLabel`
* **OSU Importer** place an .osz file in your song folder before loading the song to import BPM Changes
* **Redo** it's on ctrl+shift+z, i didn't want ctrl+y
* **Unlock Strobe/Laser Limits** note: i'll hate you forever if you press this
* **Edit lock** it's like holding alt, but all the time. Mainly for mapping extensions
* **BPM Overhaul** now adjustable placement to the millisecond and offers beat division modifiers
* **Stacked Notes Detector** i don't even know how you people make these, but here's a detector
* **Autosave Recovery** Now in editor
* **Automatic Square Image** detector and corrector
* **WIP Folder** Automatic swap over to WIP folder. If you had previously manually done this. you'll need to swap back to normal.

### Fixes and improvements
* **In place note editing** No more need to scroll to a note to move it. Alt+RMB
* **Camera Speed** No longer tied to framerate
* **Editor Settings** No longer only saves on song exit.
* **Play and Revert** Hold space and let go. no need to press the stop button anymore.
* **Bookmark Creation** No longer hijacks your cursor when you place them. Also esc cancels bookmarks now
* **More Bookmark fixes** Bookmarks no longer get screwed on editor scale changes
* **Milliseconds** now added to song time
* **Selection counter** shows how many items are selected
* **Copy-Paste** While song playing
* **Strobes** now obey BPM and work while song is playing
* **Stats Panel** will now either apply to the whole map, or selected notes/events
* **Autoupdater** is now able to update itself. This is the last manual update.
* **Wiping all your songs** should now no longer happen occasionally.
* **Freeek** no longer haunts the bottom of your screen in portrait/square orientations


### Other stuff, and bad things
* **ChromaToggle/ChromaLite** support dropped. Still accessible via beta setting, but will not be maintained further.
* **MediocreLoader** support dropped. use fpfc to explore your mapping in game. Will look into fixing this later, but it's broken for now.
* **No more source updates** due to sensitive-ish code, the source will no longer be updated. 
* **New Icon** since we're not ChromaToggle anymore, we have a new icon. All hail our cat eared overlords.
* **Donation page** I have one now, bottom of settings.

Now go find me some bugs. Also there's a bunch of stuff i probably left out. i don't log it well.
